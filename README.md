# Sasige Docs [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brainfoolong/sasige-docs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brainfoolong/sasige-docs)
The homepage for Sasige. Sasige Core can be found here https://github.com/brainfoolong/sasige

## Automatic build

The website will be automatically updated when a commit into master branch has been detected. With [continuous integration](http://sasige.0x.at/) in Travis CI we automatically build the homepage from the sources into the gh-pages branch.
