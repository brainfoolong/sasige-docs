## You are new to Sasige

If you are completely new to sasige you maybe need some setup to install the dependencies with the [quick-start guide linux](installation/quick-start-linux.html) and [quick-start guide windows](installation/quick-start-windows.html). This should only take a few minutes. Then you can go ahead with the [basic usage](installation/basic-usage.html)

## You are fully equipped

Once the one-time setup and dependency installation is done you can create [a new project](installation/create-new-project.html) in no time. If you're interested in how things work in the background and how you can customize everything, you can check out for example the [configuration](installation/configuration.html) and [directory structure](installation/directory-structure.html).
