The last step you need to do is to deploy and publish your website.

## Everything from output folder

It's pretty simple to deploy your website. Build your website with Sasige. Take everything from the output folder, mostly `public` and upload it to a hosting provider.

## Github Pages

There is a workflow to fully automate Sasige when you setup a GitHub repository that contains Sasige and than on a `gh-pages` branch that contains all website data. Goto our [continuous integration](../advanced/continuous-integration.html) for more information.
