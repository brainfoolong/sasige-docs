## Create a new project

The best way to start is to just download the [latest Starter Project Release](https://github.com/brainfoolong/sasige/releases/latest) repository. Use the `release-x.zip` file.

Unpack the zip to a directory that you wish.

Run following commands for a quick start or follow [the basic usage](basic-usage.html) document.

    ./sasige/bin/sasige build
    # => Now look into folder public or use following command
    # Or use a development webserver with
    ./sasige/bin/sasige serve
    # => Now browse to http://localhost:4433
